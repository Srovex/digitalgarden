### The Mad Lads

> We always kept the hedges trimmed. Mr. Harrens across the street measured his lawn every week, said the neighborhood‚Äôs value depended on neatness. The **Everhome Co.** men came once a month to check our health, our paperwork and to record if there was any breach of housing contract we had made. Suburbia wasn‚Äôt paradise, but it was safe. That‚Äôs what we told the kids.

> The first sign was the noise. Not the familiar hum of Arcanum, but a broken, rattling growl, like a sick dog coughing sparks. Then came the lights ‚Äî not lamps, not trams ‚Äî but flames. Orange fire rolling down the cul-de-sac, carried on the backs of a half-dozen machines that looked like someone had murdered wagons and rebuilt them with hate.

> They called themselves **Junkjawz**, though we didn‚Äôt know it at the time. Goblins in rust-plate, orcs with blowtorches for arms, a clanker whose head was just a furnace chimney. They came screaming, chanting, banging pipes together. Some rode on mechanical limbs taller than men. One giant had bolted a door onto his arm like a shield.

> Harrens tried to run, but a goblin cut him down with a pipe before he made it off the porch. They laughed like it was a game. The machines crashed through gardens, tore up the painted fences, crushed the parked cars like toys. My daughter clutched my arm so tight her nails cut my skin. My wife pulled our boy into the pantry and slammed the door, whispering prayers to Aurex and Foster.

> I peeked through the curtains. Saw a dwarf in sooty armor ripping copper wiring from the walls. Saw another pouring oil on a family‚Äôs porch, daring the house to scream. Then the biggest one, a drakona in a fire spitting war rig, lifted Harrens‚Äô new record player like a trophy and howled to the Star above - Mr. Harrens had been so proud to showing it to us - the neighborhood was his arena now.

> The looting lasted for minutes, although it felt like a eternity. And just like that, they were gone. As sudden as they‚Äôd arrived, back into the scrapyards and shadows with anything they could rip off worth selling. They left behind fire, wreckage, and a smoke heavier than screams. The hedges still stood, cut neat. But every one of us knew they meant nothing. The Brass Oath guard arrived later to catalogue the damages. But even they seemed to be under armed to face the gang. The Junkjawz had shown us: the walls of Suburbia were paper, and the strong can rule not only by rule and money, but flame and violence.

## The Favelas

As you travel inlands in the island the building start to get shorter and shorter. From the foothills to the inner forests of the Atlantis the civilization sprawls. The **Favelas** are a sprawl of shantytowns, rooftop warrens, treehouse districts, and marsh-stilt villages, tin roofed houses, huts, abandoned apartment buildings re-inhabited by orphans, castaways, homeless, vagabonds, gangs and tribes, all who are generally known as **Vergefolk**. The **Favelas** grown when other parts of the city are abandoned and shrink when the corporations demolish whole districts for developing a new suburban street full of buildings made of one mold.

To outsiders, the Favelas are chaos: gangs battling over scraps, children running barefoot in the mud, shrines covered in paint and blood. But to those who live there, they are **home** - vibrant, dangerous, alive. Food is shared, walls are painted with stories, and every night someone finds reason to sing In the air you can always hear music. 

The Favelas are ruled by gangs, each with its own values and codes. But standing above the wars of the young are the **Elders**. They are the memory-keepers, healers, and arbiters who protect the weakest and keep the balance, however fragile.

The Favelas are not a singular area, but rather a mix and match of different subcultures depending on the area and the people living there. They are a lawless sprawl built on survival, culture, and gangs and crews. Three of which are the most well-known and feared by the Vergefolk and the city officials both. Each major crew embodies a different ideology: brutality, honor, or cunning, yet they share a rhythm of violence and community that defines life here. The **Elders** maintain balance, shaping generations of Vergefolk with memory and moral weight.

#### üåä Dripline Dropouts

**River smugglers, tide-gamblers.** More of a area than an actual gang. **the Dripline** is the swampy area opposite to the downtown in the innerbay of Atlantis. Connecting the Great Lake Viridia to the ocean, the river Viridane turns into wet delta of marshes and mangrove groves. It proved impossible to build tall buildings, so instead it was filled by the shantytowns build on stilts and over the water. Masters of the swamp and shoreline, the Dropouts live on rafts, boats, and marsh huts. They deal in smuggling, black-market gambling, and river trade, always shifting with the tide. The Viridane is the lifeline of the area, and the locals call it The Low-way.

- **Main Races:** Ribbets, Galapa, Faerie, occasional Human, Halfling, Elf and others
- **Aesthetic:** driftwood, oil-slick cloaks, coral piercings
- **Culture:** **laid-back, superstitious, tide-wise**

#### üßì The Elders

- **Aesthetic:** patched coats, heirloom charms, relic tools
    
- **Culture:** **urban shamans, healers, storytellers, moral ground**
    
- **Business:** none ‚Äî their authority is in memory and respect

The Favelas are both **danger and home**: a place where every corner can bleed, but every night the music plays.
