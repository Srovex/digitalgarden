# 🛡️ Atlas Inc.
*“The Shield of the City.”*

**Field:** Security, weapons, defense.  
**Public Face:** Protectors of order and the high tech development. Their recruitment is "cool". You get to see the world and be a hero.
**Reality:** A private army with corporate polish. From coast guard to skyscraper guards, they sell protection - or the threat of its absence.

- **Protection for Sale**: safety is not a right, it’s a subscription based service. Provide “insurance” that looks a lot like extortion.
- Tied heavily to state military and mercenary contracts.
- They produce the most advanced weapons in the world.
- In addition to personal weapons they produce tanks, warship weaponry, airships, munition and are constantly developing and testing (often in real conflicts) their newest "toys" 
- Logo: Atlas lifting a shield that has a skyline of Atlantis and Arcane Needle at its center.
