# ⚙️ Vollstadt Universal (VSU)
*“The World. Made Here.”*

**Field:** Manufacturing, logistics and everything.  
**Public Face:** Builders of the prosperity of modern world. If it exists, they make it.  
**Reality:** Monopolists who hollowed out the old world and fuel Atlantis’ supremacy. They control factories, trade routes, and Arcanum batteries across the globe.

- Industrial Omnipresence: Their products are everywhere: pipes, boots, locomotives, tools, batteries, uniforms.
- Global Reach: Their ships, trains, and factories dominate trade routes. They collapsed industries abroad by undercutting prices.
- Corporate Neutrality Myth: Claim to be “just manufacturers,” but they fuel wars, empires, and rebellions alike. Whoever pays, they serve.
- Arcanum Reliance: Their batteries, pylons, and conduits allow their goods to spread across the island and beyond.
- Logo: A infinity symbol, moebius strip and a gear merged together.
