# The Favelas

As you travel inlands in the island the building start to get shorter and shorter. From the foothills to the inner forests of the Atlantis the civilization sprawls. The Favelas are a sprawl of shantytowns, rooftop warrens, treehouse districts, and marsh-stilt villages, tin roofed houses, huts, abandoned apartment buildings re-inhabited by orphans, castaways, homeless, vagabonds, gangs and tribes, all who are generally known as [[Vergefolk\|Vergefolk]]. The Favelas grown when other parts of the city are abandoned and shrink when the corporations demolish whole districts for developing a new suburban street full of buildings made of one mold.

To outsiders, the Favelas are chaos: gangs battling over scraps, children running barefoot in the mud, shrines covered in paint and blood. But to those who live there, they are **home** - vibrant, dangerous, alive. Food is shared, walls are painted with stories, and every night someone finds reason to sing In the air you can always hear music. 

The Favelas are ruled by gangs, each with its own values and codes. But standing above the wars of the young are the **Elders**. They are the memory-keepers, healers, and arbiters who protect the weakest and keep the balance, however fragile.

The Favelas are not a singular area, but rather a mix and match of different subcultures depending on the area and the people living there. They are a lawless sprawl built on survival, culture, and gangs and crews. Three of which are the most well-known and feared by the Vergefolk and the city officials both. Each major crew embodies a different ideology: brutality, honor, or cunning, yet they share a rhythm of violence and community that defines life here. The **Elders** maintain balance, shaping generations of Vergefolk with memory and moral weight.

The Favelas are both **danger and home**: a place where every corner can bleed, but every night the music plays.
