	Neon lights color the incense smoke that hangs above ground like fog. wet cobblestone mirror the light as hymns echo from cathedral courtyards. In the alleys, contracts are signed in blood as often as ink. Cutthroats slip between tramlines, blades hidden looking for their targets. The shadows of the corporate towers, the spires, stretch in the sunset. Their windows watching like cold gods. In Atlantis, faith, law, crime, and profit walk the same street. Sometimes hand in hand, sometimes hand in pocket and sometimes, hand on a knife handle.
	
	Welcome to Atlantis - a city of church, contracts, cutthroats and corporations.
