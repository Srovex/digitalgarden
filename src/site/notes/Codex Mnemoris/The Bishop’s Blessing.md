> Bells thundered through the Pantheon hall as golden banners unfurled. Incense smoke poured like waves from the altars. Rows of soldiers stood in mirrored armor, halberds gleaming under painted saints. At their head, the paladin knelt with his wings folded. His sword silver and breastplate marked with runes of judgment.
> 
> The bishop raised his hand in blessing, voice booming: “They say that Caldera is flame and hunger. A maze of bazaars and forges! But make no mistake, the Caldera is no ordinary market - it is a crucible! Smiths hammer crowns beside daggers, relics beside toys, gamblers drink beside assassins. In that chaos hides a cult that would bow to the devils and spit on the gods. Too long have they hidden beneath that mountain of depravity. They must be found, they must be judged! Steel your faith, for flame burns body and soul alike. May the Ostranox guide your blade. In the name of Ten!”
> 
> The troop struck shields in thunderous unison, a chant rolling like war-drums as they marched out into the neon night.

> When the echo of the footsteps faded, the hall shifted. Candles flickered low. From the shadows of the pillars a figure stepped into light - robes plain, eyes veiled, voice no louder than breath. An agent of the Choir of Silence.
> 
> “You send soldiers to destroy and kill the demons and their servants. When has fire quenched fire?” she murmured.
> 
> The bishop lowered from the speakers pulpit, tone now lowered, but his baritone was as sharp as a blade. “The Caldera and its denizens demand a spectacle. Only thunder and steel will root that wretched cult whom are hiding under a flame and forge. But fear not, I have use for you. The true rot lies beneath.” He leaned close, shadows warping his face. Voice even lower he added: “Beneath the streets, under our feet, they do not trade in gold or glyph. They trade in memory, in knowledge itself. Every truth they sell and every secret whispered for profit can be a seed for heresy.”
> 
> His eyes reflected the candle light like black pearls. His words hissed like cinders. “That is where you go. That is where you listen.”

## The Caldera

The mountain opens like a furnace. Cable cars rattle on steel lines, carrying crowds past glowing vents and iron bridges. Inside the hollow, markets sprawl on ledges smiths hammer blades beside jewelers cutting crowns, gamblers shout over embers, and artisans sell charms hot from the forge. The air tastes of ash and oil, lit red by molten glass. But beneath the clang and smoke, whispers run deeper. Beneath the markets, past the lifts and the ritual shafts, lie chambers where the sun light fades and fires below heat the air. There, cults gather in silence, hiding their altars in stone that drink any sacrifice. Atmosphere: volcanic heat, neon lights and forges light up the darkness, constant noise Markets: bazaars selling weapons, jewelry, relics and Arcanum trinkets Artisans: smiths, glassblowers, mechanists, flame eaters and daredevil performers Transit: cable cars and freight lifts. Bridges crisscross the crater Hidden Layers: cults, ritual chambers, outlaw shrines beneath the market. No one sane ventures to the deeper levels.

## The Undercity

The city above lives, but the stone below remembers. Underneath are mazes of caves and cellars, where old sewers twist into half-flooded corridors and doors lead to cellars that were never built for this century. Lantern-light glints off wet stone and smeared walls. Here, black markets sprawl in hollowed chambers. Memory artists etch recollections into glass vials; whisper traders lean close, selling secrets in coded breaths. Alchemists cook powders that burn like prayer. Smugglers deal with anything. Every corner invites to go deeper, and every truth has a price. Atmosphere: damp, echoing, maze-like; sewers, catacombs Truth Markets: secrets, contracts, and memories traded like currency by Whisper Traders Laboratories: outlaw technomancers, mad alchemists, forbidden miracle-work Black Markets: sex, drugs, illegal miracles Factions: Whisper Traders, techno-druid circles, outlaw miracle cults
