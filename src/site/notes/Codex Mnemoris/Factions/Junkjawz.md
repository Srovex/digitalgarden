# ðŸ”§ Junkjawz

**War-camp raiders, scrapyard engineers.** The Junkjawz rule through fear and spectacle. They cobble war-rigs from wreckage, host brutal fighting pits, and prize machines as much as muscle. Their raids into Suburbia and Downtown make them infamous.
- **Main Races:** Goblins, Orcs, Giants, Dwarves, Clankers
- **Aesthetic:** rust-plate armor, mechanical limbs, cobbled vehicles, flame throwers, mad max with goblins
- **Culture:** respect through **muscle, machine, and mayhem**
- **Business:** gladiator pits, raids, smash-and-grab heists
