# ðŸ§“ The Elders

**Memory keepers, quiet arbiters.** Neutral in turf wars, but honored by all. Elders protect the weakest, resolve disputes, and maintain the **Wall of Names** â€” a graffiti shrine to every dead Vergefolk. If an Elder calls for ceasefire, it is obeyed.

- **Aesthetic:** patched coats, heirloom charms, relic tools
- **Culture:** **urban shamans, healers, storytellers, moral ground**
- **Business:** none â€” their authority is in memory and respect
