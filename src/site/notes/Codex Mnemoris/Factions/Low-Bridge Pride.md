# üêæ Low-Bridge Pride

**Canopy guardians, natural hunters.** Situated at the heart of the island, far from the prying eye of the Pan Pantheon and corporations. The Pride live above the streets, in treehouses and rooftop camps. They see themselves as protectors of their kin and territory, bound by oaths and ancient rites. Their druids and shapeshifters make them feared and respected. Their villages form a network of green that almost resemble a forest. Rare piece of wild jungle.

- **Main Races:** Katari, Faun, Simian, occasional Firbolg
- **Aesthetic:** braided manes, bone-carved blades, rooftop banners
- **Culture:** **tribal hierarchy, deep oaths to pack and Pride**
- **Business:** vengeance raids, protective alliances, spiritual rites
