# 🏚️ Everhome Co.
*“Every Family Deserves a Home.”*

**Field:** Housing, infrastructure, domestic goods.  
**Public Face:** Builders of homes and dream lives for every class.  
**Reality:** They own the roofs, the walls, and the debts that keep people trapped beneath them. Prison wardens with picket fences.

- Manage Suburbia’s gated communities and "develop" Favelas’ districts for profit.
- Landlords for Downtown and Old Town apartments. Sell mansions and vacation homes for the rich.
- They sell safety, stability, and shelter… but contracts often bind families for generations.
- They dictate how communities grow: which districts thrive, which rot, and who lives where.
- Symbol: A house-shaped key.
